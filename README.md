# Angular2-Meteor-Boilerplate

This project is developed based on the [`angular2-meteor`](https://github.com/Urigo/angular2-meteor) package. 

The boilerplate demonstrates some basic usage of angular2 integration with meteor: 
- `MeteorReact`
- `meteor-rxjs`
- `NgModule`
- Angular Components
- Angular Forms
- Angular Pipes
- Angular Resolvers
- Angular Routings
- Angular Services
- Collections CRUD
- Collections Schema with [`collection2`](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2)
- Meteor methods
- Meteor publish/subscribe
- LESS/SASS/SCSS Support with angular2-meteor's [`css-compiler`](https://github.com/Urigo/angular2-meteor/tree/master/atmosphere-packages/css-compiler)
- Static HTML templates with [`meteor-static-templates`](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-static-templates)


You can use this app to experiment new features or to use it as a boilerplate to start `angular2-meteor` projects.
